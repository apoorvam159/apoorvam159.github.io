                <p>Hello! I'm Apoorva, and I am set to graduate from
                    <br>the University of Colorado Boulder in May 2025 with a 
                    <br>Bachelor's degree in Environmental Product Design from the
                    <br>ENVD school. My academic journey has equipped me
                    <br>with a major in Product Design and a minor in
                    <br>Creative Technology and Design. Additionally, I am in
                    <br>the process of earning a Google Certificate in UX Design.
                </p>
                <p>Over the past four years, I have honed my skills in various
                    <br>tools within the Adobe Creative Cloud, including
                    <br>Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop. I utilize Figma
                    <br>for my app designs and have experimented with Adobe XD as well.
                    <br>My experience spans user and market research, as well as
                    <br>prototyping, both through my college projects and personal endeavors.
                </p>
                <p>I am deeply passionate about app and web design and am
                    <br>eager to advance my career in this field. I love learning
                    <br>new skills and rapidly adapt to different hobbies. While I enjoy
                    <br>exploring new activities, my favorite pastimes are often home-based.
                    <br>I love to crochet, and paint, and have recently taken up cross-stitching.
                </p>
