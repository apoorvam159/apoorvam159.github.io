        <p>All about me!</p>
        <p>My name is Apoorva Maddhi! I'm a senior right now completing a major in Environmental Product Design and a minor in CTD.
            I turned 21 recently and also got a new puppy who I am absolutely and completely in love with and I miss him so much.
            He's with my parents back home right now so I see him on weekends but it's still so much time away from him.</p>
        
        <p>My goals for this class are to learn the basics of web design. I was actually going to do a separate course to teach myself HTML and CSS
            so I'm glad that I can <strong>hopefully</strong> learn a little and can then take a more complicated course so I can pursue a career in UX/UI design.
